This example shows how to wire and use a basic IR (infrared) transmitter module with the M5StickC Plus 2.

Wiring Diagram

Black wire → GND (Ground)

Red wire → 3.3V (Power)

Blue wire → GPIO pin (Data Out)

Note: Wire colors are for clarity and do not affect the way module works.

How It Works
The IR transmitter sends infrared signals controlled by the M5StickC Plus 2. You can use it to emulate remote controls or send simple IR commands.

Connecting to M5StickC Plus 2
Module Pin	M5StickC Plus 2 Pin	Wire Color (Example)
GND 	GND	   Black
3.3V	3.3V	 Red
OUT	 GPIO 26 Blue

Adjust GPIO pin as needed for your project.

Basic Usage
Connect the IR transmitter to your M5StickC Plus 2 following the wiring diagram.

Flash your firmware or script that controls the IR transmitter.

Use the firmware’s IR sending functions to transmit commands.

Tips
Make sure your transmitter LED is facing the device you want to control.

Check voltage requirements of your IR module — most work on 3.3V but verify your specific part.

Test with a TV remote or other IR receiver to confirm signal transmission.
