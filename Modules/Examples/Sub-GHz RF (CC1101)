The CC1101 is a popular low-power sub-GHz transceiver module used for wireless testing, sniffing, and pentesting in the 315MHz, 433MHz, 868MHz, and 915MHz bands. Itâ€™s often used with firmwares like Marauder for analyzing signals from remote controls, sensors, and other RF devices.

Features:

Multi-frequency operation (315/433/868/915 MHz)

Supports various modulation types (FSK, GFSK, ASK, OOK)

SPI interface for microcontroller communication

Low power consumption

Pros:

Widely supported by hacking firmwares like Marauder

Good range and reliability for sub-GHz testing

Easy to interface via SPI

Cons:

Requires SPI wiring, more pins than simple RF modules

Needs 3.3V logic compatibility

Not suitable for Bluetooth or WiFi testing

Installation & Flashing:
Use the Marauder or Bruce firmware that supports CC1101 modules. Flash the firmware via M5Burner or your preferred method.

Connecting Modules:
Connect the CC1101 pins to the M5StickC Plus 2 as follows (refer to schematic in /modules/schematics/cc1101.png):
