This guide will get your M5StickC Plus 2 ready for the first time. We’ll cover installing software, connecting the device, and uploading your first test program.

1. What You Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

M5StickC Plus 2

USB-C cable (for power and data)

Computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux

Why: The USB cable allows your computer to communicate with the M5StickC and upload code.

2. Install Arduino IDE

Download Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Install it normally, following the instructions for your operating system

Why: Arduino IDE is a program that lets you write and upload code to your M5StickC.

3. Install M5StickC Board Support

Open Arduino IDE

Go to File → Preferences

In “Additional Board Manager URLs”, add:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m5stack/M5StickC/master/package_m5stack_index.json


Go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager

Search for M5StickC and click Install

Why: Arduino IDE needs this to know how to communicate with your M5StickC.

4. Connect Your M5StickC

Plug the USB-C cable into your M5StickC and your computer

In Arduino IDE, go to Tools → Port and select the correct port

Go to Tools → Board and select M5Stick-C Plus

Why: Selecting the correct board and port ensures the code is uploaded to the right device.


5. Optional: M5Burner App

For beginners, the M5Burner app can be used to flash firmware quickly:

Download M5Burner from https://m5stack.com/pages/download

Connect your M5StickC via USB

Select your device and choose UIFlow or another firmware

Click Burn

Why: M5Burner is a fast way to install firmware without dealing with Arduino IDE directly.


Once your M5StickC is set up, you are ready to explore its features and try example programs.
