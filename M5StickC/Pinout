The M5StickC Plus 2 is small but versatile. Here’s a breakdown of its pins and what they do.

1. Power Pins
Pin	Function	              Notes
GND	Ground	                Connect to the ground of any external device or module. Essential for completing a circuit.
5V IN	External power input	Use this to power the M5StickC Plus 2 from a 5V source instead of USB or battery.
5V OUT	Power output	      Can power small external modules or LEDs. Maximum current limited—don’t overload.
3V3	3.3V output           	Some sensors or modules require 3.3V instead of 5V.
BAT	Li-Po battery voltage	  Read battery voltage or use it to monitor charge. Do not directly power external devices from BAT.
2. GPIO Pins
Pin	Function	Notes
G36	General purpose / analog input	Can read sensor signals or be used as a digital input/output.
G25	General purpose	Often used for buttons, LEDs, or small modules. Supports digital input/output.
G0	General purpose	Can be used for digital input/output or some analog tasks depending on the library.
3. Quick Tips for Beginners

GND is mandatory: Any external module or LED must share the M5StickC’s ground.

Voltage matters: Only connect 3.3V modules to 3V3, 5V modules to 5V OUT.

Start simple: Test one pin/module at a time. For example, start with an LED on G25 to see how GPIO works.

BAT is read-only for most projects: Use it to check battery level, not to power modules directly.
